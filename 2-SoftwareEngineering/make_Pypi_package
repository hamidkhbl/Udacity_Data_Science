Lest say we wanna make a package named Websites and we have two class named Medium and Linkedin 
Flow these steps to create the package:
1- Create a directory and name it Websites
2- Move your class files to the folder.
    --- Websites
            ---Medium.py
            ---Linkedin.py
3- Create setup python file in the same directory as Websites
    --- MyPackage
        --- Websites
                ---Medium.py
                ---Linkedin.py
        --- setup.py

    Content of this file should be something like this:

    from setuptools import setup
    setup(name='Websites',
            version='0.1',
            description='Learning how to make a Pypi package',
            packages=['Websites'],
            zip_safe = False)
4- Go to the Websites folder and create __init__.py file
    --- MyPackage
        --- Websites
                ---Medium.py
                ---Linkedin.py
                ---__init__.py
    --- setup.py
    you can leave the init file empty. The code inside the init file gets run whenever you import 
    a pachage inside a python program.

Now the package is ready!
5- You can go to the MyPackage directory and run pip to install the package
    pip install .
    this command will install the package you have just made.

Now lets upload our package to pypi.org (for test test.pypi.org)

6- If you don't have a pypi account register and then login

7- go to Websites directory and add following files:
    a. license.txt which include your license information(see some examples here: https://opensource.org/licenses)
    b. README.md you need to document how your package works in this file.
    c. setup.cfg you only need to put your readme file name here. the content will be something like this:
    [metadata]
    description-file = README.md

    Your directory shoul look like this:

        --- MyPackage
            --- Websites
                    ---Medium.py
                    ---Linkedin.py
                    ---__init__.py
                    ---license.txt
                    ---README.md
                    ---setup.cfg
        --- setup.py
    
8- open your terminal and cd to MyPackage directory and run this command:
    python setup.py sdidt

    running the command couple of new folders including dist will be created for you.
    inside the dist folder there is a tar.gz file that you need to upload it to the PyPi repository.

    --- MyPackage
            --- Websites
                    ---Medium.py
                    ---Linkedin.py
                    ---__init__.py
                    ---license.txt
                    ---README.md
                    ---setup.cfg
            --- dist
                ---Websites.taz.gz
        --- setup.py

9- To upload the package we need twine package, install it using pip.
    pip install twine

10- Type the following package to upload:
    twine upload --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*

    you will be asked for your user name and password for test.pypi.org
    Now you have your package on the test pypi
    you can install your package using this command:

    pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ Websites

11- To upload your package to pypi used the following command:
    twine upload dist/*

    pip uninstall Websites
    pip install Websites

Congratulations you are done!
